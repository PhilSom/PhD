# PhD
# Here the code for the numerical and experimental examination of an omnidirectional pendulum energy harvester can be found.
#
# Thesis: "An Experimental and Theoretical Study of an Omnidirectional Pendulum Energy Harvester"
#
#
# The numerical code can be found in the numerical-calculation branch.
# It shows a bifurcation diagram, a poincare section, the standard plots in the time domain of the spherical pendulum and the Lagrange calculatin of the ODEs.
